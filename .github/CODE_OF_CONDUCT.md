# Community Code of Conduct

This document provides community guidelines for a safe, respectful, productive, and collaborative place for any person who is willing to contribute to this repository. It applies to all “collaborative spaces”, which is defined as community communications channels (such as issues, patches, commit comments, message channels etc.).

   - Participants will be tolerant of opposing views.
   - Participants must ensure that their language and actions are free of personal attacks and disparaging personal remarks.
   - When interpreting the words and actions of others, participants should always assume good intentions.
   - Behaviour which can be reasonably considered harassment will not be tolerated.
   - Community guidelines in other communications channels (such as a community Discord channel) should also be read and observed.
